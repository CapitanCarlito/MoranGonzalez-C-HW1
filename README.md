Bio #1:
Hi, my name is Carlos, I'm a student at Fanshawe College in the 3D Visualization program. I used to live in London when I was younger but moved to Toronto shortly after finishing high school. While in Toronto I studied Marketing at George Brown College although I learned quite a lot in that program I decided to pursue something I was more passionate about but also dealt with business, design, and communication was the food and beverage industry. For the last ten years, I have worked in almost every conceivable concept of hospitality from clubs to speakeasies to restaurants and caf√©s. My passion for flavors, menu development, learning, and guest experience has been a big contributor to my becoming a craft bartender. One thing I am proud of is having an opportunity to working amongst some incredibly talented individuals and learn and collaborate with them.

Although I have an appreciation for bartending and mixology those disciplines are branches of design and strategy that have extended far enough for me to grab onto other branches of knowledge to further my personal and professional growth. Design is an umbrella with many different sides and the design of one has piqued my interest in the others especially that of digital design and development.

I have a few hobbies that I enjoy in my free time which include cocktail creation and playing with flavors, graphic design and making anime edits, skateboarding and functional body training, and lastly all forms of art!

Hi, you may refer to me as Shadow Carlos. I'm here to act as a secondary user and contributor to the homework assignment Carlos has to submit to class. Our team name is Balanced Daiquiri and I will show you how to make one. The tools you will be needing to make this drink are preferably a shaker set with a hawthorne strainer but mason jar or protein shaker will do just fine. Next you will also need a jigger or other measuring device to pour the exact amounts of ingredients into your shaker. Your ingredient list will be needing are fresh limes for juicing, rich syrup (2:1 sugar:water), a lighter style rum, and ice to chill and dilute your beverage. Your specs to follow are listed below:

    .25oz Rich syrup
    .75oz Lime Juice
    2oz Light rum

Shake the drink for 9 seconds for maximum chill, dilution, and aeration

DO NOT REACH FOR A BLENDER!!!!!!
